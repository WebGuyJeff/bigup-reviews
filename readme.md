# Bigup Reviews

## Publish and manage reviews!

This plugin provides a custom post type and supporting meta fields which enable users to incorporate
reviews into their posts and templates.

 - Full support for FSE/Gutenberg editor.
 - Support for classic editor (you will need to edit classic theme templates to display content).
 - Includes custom meta field blocks to use in the query loop block.

#### Plans

This is the first iteration of the plugin, and I plan to enable full dynamic generation of meta
fields then add the ability to create custom meta fields from admin. This would essentially be like
a supercharged version of WPs built-in custom field support generating custom blocks for FSE support.

Eventually I may explore dynamic building of the post types themselves, so users could create
literally any content type with a single plugin and no-code.
